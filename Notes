npm -- node pakage manager -> it is module
dependency -> external library which is used in project.

pakage.json -> a file which has data of all dependency and their version number

script -> it has command of npm. with the help of these command we execute some process.


difference between dependencies vs devdependencies -> those library which is required for local as well as hoisting/deploy and for build called dependencies  and  thoes library which is required for only local purpose/development purpose called devdependencies.

. without pakage.json file we can run react project.But it is more important file..

pakage-lock.json -> it has recored of all dependency in very detealed manner and it has recored of dependencies of dependency...

public folder is first folder and index.js is first opening file of react project.

build tool => react-script/parcel/webpack/gulp etc....(webpack is best among ) it is compiling all individual file and give you a final file for deploy...

react-script is build tool(or compiler) which is helping me for running js project...

ReactDOM -> it is a library and it helps react to for managing the DOM. without ReacrDOM no output appear in browser..

ReactDOM is object and render is method of reactDOM.

Render methode require two parameter first is components name and dom location Example->ReactDOM.render(<App/>,document.getElementById("root"));
